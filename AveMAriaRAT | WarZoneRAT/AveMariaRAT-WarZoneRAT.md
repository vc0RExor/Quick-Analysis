# _Overview

_AveMariaRAT, also known as WarZoneRAT, is one of the most famous and widely used RATs in recent years. It can be purchased with a license and monthly subscriptions ranging from $16 to $38 on its website. This tool is used and modified by various groups, ranging from disorganized or resource-limited individuals known as script kiddies to highly relevant criminal groups or APTs._

_Some of the notable groups that have been observed using AveMariaRAT include:_

* Tomiris ( üè¥ )
* Carbanak | Anunak ( üá∫üá¶ )
* Aggah ( üè¥ )
* BlindEagle | APT-C-36 ( üá®üá¥ )
* Confucious ( üáÆüá≥ )
* SideWinder ( üáÆüá≥ )
* HazyTiger | Bitter ( üáÆüá≥ )
* FIN7 ( üè¥ )
* SandWorm Team | Voodo Bear ( üá∑üá∫ )
* Kasablanka ( üè¥ )

_This malware, used by the mentioned groups, can infiltrate the infrastructure in various ways, from exploiting Spear-Phishing to compromising websites where it is downloaded. Once on our devices, the RAT has capabilities to escalate privileges, bypass UAC, evade defenses like security software, gather sensitive information from the device and user, and inject itself into processes to maintain active communication with the C&C server operated by the attacker_

# _Technical Anlysis

As I mentioned earlier, the threat actor commonly utilizes compromised emails or web pages with the ultimate goal of getting you to download or execute the malware sample after passing stage number 1.

An example step-by-step process of various samples I have analyzed from different versions of AveMariaRAT could be as follows:

The executions vary greatly depending on the version, but typically it tries to determine if it is already running on the machine using a Mutex

After that, it can perform anti-dbg/Anti-VM tasks or directly check for security software that may be installed on the system

A common practice in AveMaria RAT is privilege escalation or bypassing UAC. The most common method involves abusing sdclt.exe, which, similar to CompMgmtLauncher (Windows console), searches for a library or component in a registry that is normally not present. This is exploited for hijacking by introducing a library that will be loaded, and these binaries usually have the capability to elevate themselves, allowing them to execute with higher privileges, thus running the malware with the desired privileges

Here you can see this parallelism with a PoC I made some time ago and we can see that it seeks the same in both cases:

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/b72185d5-ad06-4245-a594-b0e234cedd40)

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/5796da24-e061-4dba-ac08-d771a9c7dfa0)

The overall picture of how this is done with sdclt is as follows:

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/5cbc41c7-9720-4e12-bfb4-e27476a6fb7b)

Depending on the sample, there is usually a subsequent resource loading for the injection. This can be found in the resource section of the binary, and as seen, it checks if you are already an administrator, so the previous step should have been executed

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/311152d1-cecb-45cc-b9d7-3102106e3eb5)

A common practice I have observed in WarZone RAT is modifying network elements, as well as modifying keys like _\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings_, where it increases the maximum number of simultaneous connections to a server. The objective for this is evident

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/e37b4a51-e562-4b72-a543-c2e9550fee7d)

Additionally, it is also quite common to see the modification of Zone.Identifier, which allows the attacked machine to receive malicious files from untrusted sources. In other contexts, the connection would be rejected or warned as an unadvisable request. However, after the modification, the malware can send and execute any type of file, bypassing any previous warning or restriction.

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/62fe4010-fdb8-4d70-8ba8-1dbad1a58c4a)

Furthermore, it is also common for the malware to make changes in security checks of certain browsers, such as Internet Explorer (IE). By changing the registry key, it can increase access to certain addresses to complement its previous behavior

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/3268f312-3a1b-4883-9ef8-4e1cde5e9c51)

After this, it is common for the malware to establish persistence. Depending on the sample, it may create a copy of itself and then add the path to \CurrentVersion\Run (or similar) registry key, or it may leave a copy of itself or a script in a startup folder that will be executed on system startup

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/e331bb0a-b437-476b-b59a-4d51b7dc2df5)

In some samples, I frequently observe the modification of folder attributes where the malware launches its copies or files it intends to use or execute. It is common to launch them in a folder like Documents or Downloads and modify the attributes to point to another location, such as ApplicationData or ProgramData. For example, it would be seen as Documents:ApplicationData. This action allows the malware to evade restrictions or security policies of the initial folder where the files are launched and potentially remain undetected. The telemetry data always reflects this pattern

```
<Original folder where the samples are launched>:<Folder with modified attributes>
```

During the analysis of different samples, I notice the consistent use of various anti-debugging techniques along with frequent sleep commands that significantly slow down debugging. This forces me to bypass them entirely

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/9d37ae62-f70a-4340-986a-0ef007d5bce4)

Once the sample achieves persistence, the files are launched in the desired folder, and the appropriate privileges are obtained, it commonly proceeds with the injection process. Injection serves multiple purposes: to remain hidden, complicate analysis, and ensure better persistence by residing within the target process. If the process being injected into has elevated privileges, the injected code will also inherit those privileges

Here we can see different injections performed by this RAT based on different compilations. Commonly, it extracts the code from a specific section and constructs it in memory for subsequent injection. Alternatively, it may assemble or deobfuscate the code from a resource. The target process varies depending on the samples, but I have observed processes related to .NET (such as AppLaunch, csc, RegAsm...) or the RAT itself (either a sample launched with a different name in another folder or self-executing and injecting)

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/2ec84d3b-b39b-4aa0-a0a3-1d8fe0e8d858)

After this, the malware payload will be within another process and can act more freely. At this point, the most common action is to gather relevant information about the device and/or the user, such as the operating system type, machine name, language used, etc.

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/69179cec-8458-4aeb-bc6e-dfe68fe6b39d)

Once the previous steps have been completed, the attacker focuses on establishing an external connection. Typically, the malware will have different addresses to attempt to gain access. It will commonly try to establish a connection by opening a socket to the chosen address. In the samples I have analyzed, I have observed that the malware often enters a loop where it attempts to connect to different domains from its list at regular intervals. The malware will remain waiting for instructions from the command and control (C&C) server

![image](https://github.com/vc0RExor/Quick-Analysis/assets/91592110/000c8f31-7b81-44ad-b145-0da187865539)

Once the connection is established, the attacker has achieved the desired objective: a malware injected into a process, whether legitimate or not, from which they can operate. They have modified network parameters, controlled security software, obtained data about the target system, and established persistence for each system login
